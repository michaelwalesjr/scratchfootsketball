# scratchfootsketball
My first public made program built in scratch. Its a game that's allow you to score points similar to football.


Setup & Controls:
1. Press the green flag to begin.
2. Press Space bar to hike the ball.
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate the playing.

How To Play:
After you press the spacebar to begin. Make sure to wait for the dialogue from the two characters to end before you can move.

You as the Football Player must get to the opposite (thick) white goal line to score a point. Once you score 5 points, you win and the game is over. However, If the Bear touches you at any point, you lose and the game is over!

Good Luck 
& Have Fun!!!
